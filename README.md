# 345_huffman
A program written in Java that will take text and encode it following a greedy Huffman
Encoding algorithm. 

## Test Instructions

### Compression Ratio Calculator:
This test file calculates the compression ratios of 2 .txt files and compares their compression ratios. 
Two files, "Lorem.txt" and "random.txt" have been provided. The compression ratio is equal to the uncompressed
size divided by the compressed size. This test will prompt the user for input through the console. When it 
asks for a file name that should be the file path such as 'Lorem.txt' followed by enter/return. The test will
run the encoding procedure and report which file was compressed more efficiently.
